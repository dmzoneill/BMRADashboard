These 'Widgets' are simply Marvin Grids that use the SVG Widget to create various
shapes that are inspired by the ICLEAR interface first shown in Star Trek: The Next Generation
computer screens.

They are not perfect, and can be difficult to get everything to line up, but with some
effort and forethought, you can do some pretty cool stuff.

Most of information I based the ICLEAR stuff off of, including the fonts came from here:
